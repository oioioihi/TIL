1. In-Memory : 

   whatever data you store, it is going to be stored in memory. Reading from memory is probably 100 to 1000 times faster than reading from disk.

2. Fast : 

   Reading from memory is probably 100 to 1000 times faster than reading from disk. => 데이터를 읽고 쓰는 작업을 메모리 레벨에서 처리하기 때문에 레디스가 빠르다.

   

3. Open Source : 

   C언어로 개발 되었고, 오픈소스이다.

4. Key-Value Datastore :

   

5. Persistence : 

   Even the servier's power goes off, your are not going to lose any of the data, because along with storing the data in memory, all the data which is there in memory can also be stroed on disk.

6. High Availability : redis gives you an option to scale any number of nodes.

7. Distributed Cluster : 클러스터 환경 제공
